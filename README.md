# stock_portfolio_tracker_app
Single Page App to allow tracking of stock portfolio current value as well as historical performance.

Fork of repo from a shared project with Simon Hall and Chae Nicholson.

## Future development
Future work on project would focus on code refactoring of functions which take raw data from external API and iterates over the data to get it into the form required for Google Charts API.
Also, I would like to try and implement HighCharts into the app in place of Google Charts.
